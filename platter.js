Using the following tech stack:

- `HTML`
- `JavaScript`
- `TailwindCSS`

The main objective of this tech challenge is to see your ability to create designs using `TailwindCSS` and well structured semantic `HTML`.

The design needs to be fully responsive (desktop/mobile). Please use plain JS (VanillaJS) for any functionality. The scrollbar thumb should increase to 6px height when hovering / touching it, this will require hiding the default browser scrollbar. 

The Show More button (mobile only) should trigger a dropdown revealing the other product cards.
